Key Features:

Homepage Layout: Mimics the layout of Amazon's homepage, showcasing featured products and categories.
Product Listing: Displays products with images, titles, prices, and brief descriptions in a similar style to Amazon's listings.
Navigation: Includes a header and footer, resembling Amazon's navigation structure.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web pages.
CSS: Styles the HTML elements to replicate the visual aspects of Amazon's interface.

This project serves as a practice exercise for HTML and CSS skills. It's a static representation of Amazon's design and layout, focusing on visual fidelity without backend functionalities or dynamic content.
